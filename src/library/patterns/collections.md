## Design

### Header only
{% include "patterns/collection.md" %}

### Default
{% assign collection = collection-default %}
{% include "patterns/collection.md" %}

### Media Thumbnail
{% assign collection = collection-img %}
{% include "patterns/collection.md" %}

### Calendar
{% assign collection = collection-date %}
{% include "patterns/collection.md" %}

## Smokefree styling
This uses `primary` for the [color](http://localhost:8080/library/styles/colors/) and it pulls in the default [typography](http://localhost:8080/library/styles/type/).



<div class="usa-accordion">
  <h4 class="usa-accordion__heading">
    <button
      type="button"
      class="usa-accordion__button"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-controls="e1"
    >
      Other USWDS Settings for further branding
    </button>
  </h4>
  <div id="e1" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">

- `$theme-collection-font-family` Font family for collection body.
- `$theme-collection-header-typeset` Family, size, and line height of the heading.
</div>
</div>

## Variations
- `.usa-collection--condensed` A more condensed item presentation with less space between items.
- 
## Library prototyping notes
To use the data driven smart pattern, you'll need to set your content in the YAML front matter or in a data file.

### Settings
- condensed | default is false - no need to include if not wanted
  
### Collection Settings
these go within the `list` property of the card yml.
