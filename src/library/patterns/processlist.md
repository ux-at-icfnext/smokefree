## Library prototyping notes
To use the data driven smart pattern, you'll need to set your content in the YAML front matter or in a data file.

``` yml
processlist:
  - title: List item 1
    content: content
  - title: List item 2
    content: content
```

Include the pattern using this code:

``` markdown
 {{ include }}
```
